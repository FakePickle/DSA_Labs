# DSA Labs Documentation

This repository contains the documentation and solutions for the Data Structures and Algorithms labs completed during the semester, written in C programming language.

## Lab 1: Array Operations

### Overview
- **Objective**: Implement basic operations on arrays.
- **Topics Covered**: Array manipulation, searching, and sorting algorithms.
- **Files**: `pa1.c, pa1.h`, `README.md`.

### Description
This lab focused on implementing fundamental operations on arrays, including sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort in C. The `pa1.c` file contains C implementations of these algorithms along with relevant explanations and examples.

### How to Compile and Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `PA1` directory.
3. Compile the C file using a C compiler, e.g., `make clean; make`
4. Run the compiled test cases. There are three test cases in total., e.g., `make submit test1`, to execute the test cases and observe the algorithms in action.

## Lab 2: Tree Traversal Algorithms

### Overview
- **Objective**: Implement tree traversal algorithms (e.g., inorder, preorder, postorder).
- **Topics Covered**: Binary trees, traversal techniques in C.
- **Files**: `pa2.c, pa2.h`, `README.md`.

### Description
This lab focused on implementing various tree traversal algorithms (inorder, preorder, postorder) for binary trees in C. The `pa2.c` file contains C implementations of these traversal methods along with explanations, demonstrating how each traversal technique works on a binary tree.

### How to Compile and Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `PA2` directory.
3. Compile the C file using a C compiler, e.g., `make clean; make`.
4. Run the compiled test cases. There are four test cases in total, e.g., `make submit test1`, to execute the test cases and observe the tree traversal algorithms.

## Lab 3: Trie Node Algorithms

### Overview
- **Objective**: Implement trie nodes for efficient string search and storage.
- **Topics Covered**: Trie data structure, string manipulation in C.
- **Files**: `pa3.c, pa3.h`, `README.md`.

### Description
This lab involved implementing trie nodes in C for efficient string search and storage. The `pa3.c` file contains the code for constructing trie data structures, insertion, searching, and deletion operations on trie nodes. It also includes examples and explanations illustrating how trie nodes work for strings.

### How to Compile and Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `PA3` directory.
3. Compile the C file using a C compiler, e.g., `make clean; make`.
4. Run the compiled test cases. There are three test cases in total, e.g., `make submit test1`, to execute the test cases and observe the trie node implementations.


## Lab 4: Graph Algorithms

### Overview
- **Objective**: Implement common graph algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS).
- **Topics Covered**: Graph data structure, traversal algorithms in C.
- **Files**: `pa4.c, pa4.h`, `README.md`.

### Description
This lab involved implementing graph algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) for traversing graphs in C. The `pa4.c` file contains C implementations of these algorithms along with examples and explanations demonstrating their functionalities on various types of graphs.

### How to Compile and Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `PA4` directory.
3. Compile the C file using a C compiler, e.g., `make clean; make`.
4. Run the compiled test case. There is one test case in total., e.g., `make submit test1`, to execute the test case and observe the graph traversal algorithms.
